# Movie-Recommendation-System
The Movie Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity is a project that uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to suggest movies
to users based on their preferences. The system works by calculating the similarity between different movies based on various attributes such as
genre, director, actors, etc. and recommends movies that are similar to the ones that the user has already enjoyed.
